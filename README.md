# Elixilorem
[![Master](https://travis-ci.org/mgamini/elixilorem.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mgamini/elixilorem)

## Getting Started
It is *(will be)* a Hex.pm package, so drop it in like every other package:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [{:elixilorem, "~> 0.0.1"}]
end
```

## What does it do?
Based upon [Dimsum](https://github.com/ninjascribble/dimsum) by my buddy Scott, it generates filler text for your Elixir project. This is particularly useful for web projects (see [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix)).

## Usage
Coming soon
